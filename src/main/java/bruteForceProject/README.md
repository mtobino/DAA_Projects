# Brute Force Project

Status: Finished <br />
Project 1: Project 1 runs smoothly and efficiently through all of the cnf files. The project uses binary addition on a boolean array to test 
all of the possibilites. The main loop does not check for the number of all possibilities, rather it checks for whether or not a result has been found. 
The code will list a cnf as unsatisfiable if it detects that the boolean array is all true and has already been tested. 
If it detects a case where the file is satisfiable, it will print out the solution array and that the file is satisfiable.
