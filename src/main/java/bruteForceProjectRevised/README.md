# Brute Force Project

Revised version of the Brute Force Project to no longer use the static methods in the old version. Instead, the code takes a more object-oriented approach and delegates the tasks to other classes/objects. 
The project still functions as normal by taking in a formatted CNF file, parsing the data from the file into clauses, and attempting to prove satisfiability. The code 
uses boolean addition to test every possible case for each variable in the file.
